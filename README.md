# Insure landing page
This landing page was part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor, where I should build it according to the design system given, respecting the responsiveness required.

To complete this challenge, I used HTML5 and CSS3 alongside SASS and VanillaJS to optimize the site's layout depending on their device's screen size and implemented BEM Methodology to write cleaner and more readable classes.
